As a private tutor, I would coordinate and work with a variety of different clients, tutoring kids grades K-10. I create personal learning plans with each student to cater to different needs as a learner and tutor subjects including math, science, history, and English. My lessons range anywhere from introductory English lessons to high school science and math, or even history. My goal as a tutor is to help establish children's confidence in learning and to view learning as a fun process rather than an outcome. That way, students can utilize problem-solving techniques and methods for life-long learning.
