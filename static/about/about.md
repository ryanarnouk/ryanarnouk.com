Hello! My name is Ryan Arnouk. I am a student interested in software, engineering, math, machine learning, business, and finance. I love learning, building new projects, reading, and teaching. 

I have been programming over the past 5 years as a hobby acquiring knowledge in web development, JavaScript, Java, Python, etc. I have interned at start-up Invitation Codes as a frontend web developer as well. 

I also have services available. I run my own private tutoring business, tutoring kids aged K-10 via Zoom online and I am available for hire. [Click here to learn more](./services)
